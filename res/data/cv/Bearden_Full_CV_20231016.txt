Discovered non-monotonic trends in dampening of relaxation oscillations in photon output density.* Discovered the desirably short decay time - a measure of relaxation to steady-state values in lasers - is achieved forshort spin relaxation times.* Related short decay time to a significant reduction in bit-error rate for a digital data signal generated by a spin laser.Publications* Efficient solution of Boolean satisfiability problems with digital memcomputing, S.R.B Bearden, Y.R.
