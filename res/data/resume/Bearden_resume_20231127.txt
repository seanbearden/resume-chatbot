Used Vehicle Auction Model	2021 – 2023

Conceived and created a data-driven online auction bidding model for the used vehicle market, which involved integrating comprehensive vehicle data, creating predictive pricing models, and designing a customer-centric interface to enable tailored bidding strategies. This innovative tool significantly improved market valuation accuracy and bidding efficiency, representing a breakthrough in bridging data science with practical market applications.

Underwriting with Decision Trees	2022 – 2023

Developed a sophisticated decision tree model using scikit-learn to optimize loan underwriting, integrating various products and ensuring compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act, resulting in a more efficient, cost-effective, and transparent loan decisioning process. This innovative approach effectively replaced the rigid waterfall method with a dynamic, multi-stage decision-making process, enhancing both ROI and loan origination rates.	CONTACT
