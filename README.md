# Ask The Resume Chatbot

Engage recruiters and hiring managers effortlessly with a chatbot that personifies your professional journey. The Professional Resume Chatbot is designed to facilitate an interactive exploration of a job seeker's credentials, encompassing resumes, CVs, publications, projects, and more. Tailor the chatbot's responses through a predefined Q&A segment to ensure it aligns with your narrative. Hosted on Heroku, this chatbot delivers a personalized user experience by engaging with session histories. All interactions are securely logged in a DynamoDB table, set up through AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM).

## Getting Started

### Preparation
1. Populate the [res/data](./res/data) directories with the applicant's files, preferably text files to optimize costs. (A sample PDF is included). Each directory here acts as a distinct tool. Add or remove directories as required, ensuring they are duly listed in [documents_info.json](./res/data/documents_info.json) to aid the chatbot in tool selection.

### Indexing
2. Execute [create_vector_store.py](./create_vector_store.py) to establish index databases via FAISS.

### Deployment
3. Prepare for Heroku deployment ensuring `gunicorn` is listed in [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt). Utilize the Heroku CLI for deployment as outlined in [Heroku's Documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/creating-apps).
4. Configure key-value pairs on Heroku.
5. Build and deploy using SAM, must specify Docker context `DOCKER_ENDPOINT`. Follow [these](https://github.
   com/aws/aws-sam-cli/issues/4329#issuecomment-1732670902) instructions to determine location of host.
    ```bash
    DOCKER_HOST=DOCKER_ENDPOINT sam build --use-container -t template.yaml
    DOCKER_HOST=DOCKER_ENDPOINT sam deploy --guided

    ```
5. Run the following commands to deploy on heroku:
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "initial commit"
    git push heroku main
    ```
